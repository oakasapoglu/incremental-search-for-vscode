### Added

- Initial release
  The project is created and has only 3 keybindings.
- Now, <Ctrl-f> keys after entering the find mode will move
  the cursor to the next match.
- <left> and <right> keys are bound to command CloseFindWidget to
  exit find mode in a  more conveniently way than the <escape> key.
- This is probably the last version of the project.
